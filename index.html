                  Making the decision to go to China over my summer vacation was one of the best decisions I had ever made. But if you would have asked me at our arrival I would have thought otherwise. After a 13 hr flight, which I slept for about 6 of those hours, I was tired and ready to stretch my legs. Only to step out of the plane into an environment that could only be mistaken for the entrance to hell itself. I mean no air conditioning, 105*F, and only about 110% humidity if I had to guess. Tired and now sweating, I make my way to the bus to try to take a nap on the bus ride, since it was gonna be another 1.5 hrs to get to our hotel, I get bugged by people telling me I could not take a nap cause I need to avoid “Jet Lag”! I politely turn to and say, “I’m not trying to be rude, but if you wake me up again we are gonna have a problem.” Then I turned back over to take a nap. Sure enough they got the point, and I got to take my nap. Never got “Jet Lag” either.

                  This story gets pretty nuts, and we are lucky we are not in jail today for trespassing. Please do not report this to the China officials. So we went to the mountains to get away from the city life and a few guys and myself decided to go for a walk. We passed by a few farms, some small shops, an abandoned building… you see where this is going. We break into the abandoned building to find out it is actually a modern Communist Museum! So we start looking around, playing tag, hoping over the walls that you're not supposed to climb over, etc. You know normal things. Then we make our way to the back entrance where we see a part of the Great Wall in the distance. So we climb up the walls to get to the mountains to go venture off to see the great wall. Then we found out this building, we thought was abandoned, was not… We hear some loud mandarin in the background and sure enough get rounded but by “security” aka 70 yr old men still working cause no one can afford to retire. Luckily they just escorted us off the property, and made gestures like don’t come back. So we got lucky, but it was definitely an experience I will never forget.

                  Speaking of the Gregit at Wall we visited that too. Disclaimer this is not the cleanest story, but neither is the next one. Anyway, going to the Great Wall with a butch of guys is fun, but going with a bunch of college guys is even more fun. Why you ask, well I’ll tell you. We had a few “objectives” going to the great wall. One, trust falls off the great wall. Two, go “Balls to the Wall”. Use your imagination for that one. And the last and most important was to relieve yourself of the Great Wall. This was a right of passage for MEN going on the trip. Obviously, you didn’t need to, but you’d be “that guy” that didn’t join in. So after completing the first two objectives the guys start taking turns going to a distant part of the wall where no one could see them do the deed. Sure enough it becomes me and my buddies turn. We make it down there while the other guys play interference and I’m in and out in no time. My buddy struggles though. I told him, “Bro you can’t wus out now you gotta make something happen.” He lets me know he is trying but he doesn’t need to go number 1. He needs to go number 2… I start laughing and let him know we are 5 miles away from any place to get off the wall to do that, so it’s either now or he could be the guy that crapped his pants while on the Great Wall. Sure enough he gets it done and his legend is cemented beside, and partly on, the Great Wall. Again, please don’t report us.

                  If one poop story wasn’t enough; I have a second one for you. As you can probably guess, the typical American diet and Chinese diets are quite different. Well this is a problem for many people who go to China for an extended period of time, and remind you we were there for 3 months. So many people usually end up pooping their pants and become one of the people that pooped their pants on the trip. We called this La Dutsa. An uncontrollable form of diarrhea that could hit at any time, and when it does very few make it out alive with pants intact. Well, this happened to me, it was a gloomy acid rain cloud day. Actually, it was not that hot for a Chinese summer, and I was walking with my friends, when out of nowhere… Knock Knock… I let my friends know what’s up and took off in my potty run. I make it to the market only to forget all the mandarin I know, but eventually find a place to direct me upstairs to a bathroom. I open the door and BOOM. A heat wave hits me like no other. The gates of hell all of a sudden look like a winter vacation to Alaska. I was sweating holding everything together, and now I was sweating worse than I have ever in my life! I fought for my life in that squatty. Time stood still, eventually I was completely naked trying not to sweat through all my clothes. I felt like I was caught in Itachi's genjutsu from Naruto. After many attempts to free myself, and about 15 lbs lighter, I made it out with my pants still clean. I walk downstairs and find my friends starting to eat. As we make eye contact there is just a gentle nod between us. Each of us knows what I went through and we were grateful to be alive.

                  These were just a few of the stories I had while in China, and outside of the fun and games I learned a lot. It was one of the first times I had been to a country that really didn’t speak much if any english. And got to see the literal other side of the world. I made many friends from different parts of the US and many Chinese friends as well. Got to learn more about a culture personally vs just reading or being told from my friends that either lived there or visited in the past. This is why I love to travel and learn about other cultures from around the world. They give me a different perspective and appreciation of things I see in my daily life, and I can't wait to make more memories traveling in the future as well.
